# Code challenges

This repo is a collection of code challenges and topics for interviews that I've picked up over the years.
A lot of these are pulled from sources on the internet and may be incomplete or lack test cases.
Originally this was intended to be a teaching guide and collection of reference material, but it's just a personal reference for interviews now.
