# Big O Notation

Examples inspired by Cracking The Coding Interview.

File `master.js` contains a test of Big O topics.

Individual example files contain the answers.

Key takeaways:
1. Drop constants
2. Nested loops
3. Sum of numbers 1 thru N, drop non dominant terms
4. Inputs of different size
5. More constants (calculation not dependent on input size)
6. More constants (only 1/2 of the input is still 1/2 of Infinity)
7. All together
